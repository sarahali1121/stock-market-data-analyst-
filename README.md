1. Introduction
The stock market is an essential component of a country's economy and an attractive platform for investors. Understanding stock price trends and performing analysis helps in making informed financial decisions. In this project, we conducted exploratory data analysis and built a linear regression model to predict stock prices, with a specific focus on Apple Inc. (AAPL).

4. Dataset Description
The dataset contains historical stock data with the following fields:
•	Date: Trading date
•	Ticker: Stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, etc.)
•	Open, High, Low, Close: Daily prices
•	Volume: Trading volume
The data was cleaned, sorted by Ticker and Date, and then used for further analysis.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5.1. Moving Average and Volatility
•	For each stock, 20-day moving average and volatility were calculated.
•	Plots of Close price vs 20-Day Moving Average and Volatility over time were generated.
5.2. Correlation Matrix
•	Correlation among stock tickers was visualized using a heatmap.
•	Helped understand how prices of different companies are related.
5.3. Closing Price Distribution
•	A histogram with KDE showed how closing prices are distributed.
5.4. Price Trends
•	Plotted closing prices over time for all tickers to observe trends and seasonal changes.
5.5. Volume vs Price
•	Scatter plot revealed relationship between trade volume and closing prices.
5.6. Boxplot of Prices by Ticker
•	Boxplots visualized price variation across different companies.

6. Predictive Analysis: AAPL Price Prediction
6.1. Features Used
•	Independent Variables: Open, High, Low, Volume
•	Target Variable: Close
6.2. Method
•	Data was split into training and testing sets (80/20 split).
•	StandardScaler used for normalization.
•	Linear Regression model trained and evaluated.
6.3. Results
•	Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1.089
•	R² Score: 0.985
Interpretation: The model performed very well with a high R² score, indicating accurate prediction of AAPL stock prices.
